                    Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything we know of was an infinitesimal singularity.
                    Then, according to the Big Bang theory, it burst into action, inflating faster than the speed of light in all directions for a tiny fraction of a second.
                    Before 10^-32 seconds had passed, the universe had exploded outward to 10^26 times its original size in a process called cosmic inflation.
                    And that's all before the actual expansion of matter that we usually think of as the Big Bang itself, which was a consequence of all this inflation: As the inflation slowed, a flood of matter and radiation appeared, creating the classic Big Bang fireball, and
                    began to form the atoms, molecules, stars and galaxies that populate the vastness of space that surrounds us.

                    That mysterious process of inflation and the Big Bang have convinced some researchers that multiple universes are possible, or even very likely.
                    According to theoretical physicist Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University in Massachusetts, inflation didn't end everywhere at the same time.
                    While it ended for everything that we can detect from Earth 13.8 billion years ago, cosmic inflation in fact continues in other places.
                    This is called the theory of eternal inflation. And as inflation ends in a particular place, a new bubble universe forms, Vilenkin wrote for Scientific American in 2011.
